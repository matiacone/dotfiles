description: Run TypeScript type checking and fix any type errors found
---

Run `bun run check-types` to check for TypeScript type errors across the project. If any type errors are found, analyze and fix them systematically. Focus on:

1. Missing type annotations
2. Incorrect type assertions
3. Import/export type issues
4. Generic type constraints
5. Interface/type definition problems

After fixing errors, run the command again to verify all issues are resolved.
