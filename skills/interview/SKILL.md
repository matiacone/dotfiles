# Interview Skill

Drive a deep requirements interview before implementation.

## Objective

Build shared understanding by walking each decision branch and resolving dependencies one-by-one.

## Process

1. Start with one high-leverage question about goals and success criteria.
2. Ask focused follow-up questions on UX, data model, workflows, edge cases, and constraints.
3. Clarify tradeoffs explicitly (speed vs flexibility, defaults vs customization, etc.).
4. Confirm assumptions and summarize decisions after each major branch.
5. End with a concise implementation-ready brief and open questions.

## Interview Style

- Ask one targeted question at a time.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract prompts.
- Surface hidden dependencies early.
- Challenge ambiguity until requirements are testable.
